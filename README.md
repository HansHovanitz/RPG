# Dungeon Crawl Text-Based RPG

Forward:
I started this project after taking my first Java course to help reinforce what I had learned. 
I never finished it though...until now. 

I thought it would be fun to try and figure out what I was thinking at the time I started this project and to see how my coding techniques have changed and grown. I kept the style generally the same while adding new content. I found myself scratching my head at times wondering why I chose to implement some of the things in the way I did. I think this was largely due to the fact I didn't really have a firm grasp on what I was doing and I did not really plan things out ahead of time,I just started coding and added things as I went. If I were to redo this project I would map out a plan to reduce redundancy and make the flow of the code more clear.
